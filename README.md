# Mini-Game Project

Welcome to the Mini-Game project! This is a simple Text-based game where you control a character to consume objects and gain different states.

## Features

### Player and Object Interaction

- **Player Movement:** Use arrow keys to move the character across the screen.

- **Object Consumption:** The character can consume objects, and this affects the character's state.

### Player Status

- **Player Status Update:** The player's status is updated based on the type of object consumed.

- **Movement Speed:** The player's movement speed is affected by the consumed object.

### Object Regeneration

- **Object Regeneration:** Once an object is consumed, it regenerates in a new location to keep the game going.

### Game Termination

- **Unsupported Character:** If an unsupported character is pressed, the game terminates gracefully.

- **Terminal Window Resizing:** If the terminal window is resized during gameplay, the game will exit and display a message.

## Getting Started

To run the mini-game, simply clone this repository and execute the game program. Follow the on-screen instructions to control the character and enjoy the game!
